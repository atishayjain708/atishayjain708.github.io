            <p>Hi, I am Atishay Jain - a Computer Science engineering Final year student. </p>
            <p> My first experience with programming was in class 8th in school. Ever since, I have been building upon my love for coding; from writing basic programs in Java back in school to Android development, using React, Python scripts and several other tools and frameworks today. I am greatly interested in computer science and finance.
              in the field of development, I have experience with languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, C++, and basic HTML/CSS. I am well-versed with the concepts of OOPS and also have experience with Android Development. Infact, an app <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=garbagecollectors.com.unipool">Unipool</a></span> that I worked on, as part of a team, is up on the Play Store.I have also had some experience using tools and frameworks such as Tensorflow, ReactJS, Docker and AWS. Currently Iâ€™m working in and increasing my knowledge of the machine learning and data-science domain, focussing specifically on deep learning and neural networks.
